Reconciliation of Adjusted Financial Measures to GAAP Measures
In addition to its reported operating results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), EXL has included in this release
certain financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures, including the following:
i. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin;
ii. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin;
iii. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
iv. Revenue growth on constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, should not be considered a substitute
for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Accordingly, the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial statements should be
carefully evaluated. EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial
performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide
useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s
results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable
compensation of its employees. The Company believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in
accordance with GAAP, or a qualitative reconciliation thereof, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the Company’s inability to predict
its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with future acquisitions and the
currency fluctuations and associated tax effects. As such, the Company presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. The
Company also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.
EXL non-GAAP financial measures exclude, where applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, restructuring costs, litigation settlement costs and associated legal fees, effects of termination of leases, certain defined social security
contributions, allowance for certain material expected credit losses, other acquisition-related expenses or benefits and effect of any non-recurring tax
adjustments. Acquisition-related expenses or benefits include, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, external deal costs, integration
expenses, direct and incremental travel costs and non-recurring benefits or losses. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS also excludes
the effects of income tax on the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The effects of income tax of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate
of the local tax regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.
A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial
measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are
recurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such
non-GAAP financial measures.
EXL’s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the Philippine peso, the U.K. pound sterling and the South African rand. The average
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 82.20 during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to 83.42 during the quarter
ended June 30, 2024, representing a depreciation of 1.5% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine
peso increased from 55.58 during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to 58.29 during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing a depreciation of
4.9% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.25 during the quarter
ended June 30, 2023 to 1.26 during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing an appreciation of 0.8% against the U.S. dollar. The average
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the South African rand decreased from 19.02 during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 to 18.53 during the
quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing an appreciation of 2.6% against the U.S. dollar.

A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial
measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are
recurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such
non-GAAP financial measures.
EXL’s primary exchange rate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The average exchange rate of the
U.S. dollar against the Indian rupee increased from 82.31 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to 83.28 during the quarter ended December
31, 2023, representing a depreciation of 1.2% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso
decreased from 56.76 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to 55.86 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, representing an
appreciation of 1.6% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar increased from 1.19 during
the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to 1.25 during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, representing an appreciation of 5.4% against the U.S.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to
numerous uncertainties and factors relating to EXL's operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond EXL’s control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning EXL’s possible or assumed future results of operations, including
descriptions of its business strategy. These statements may include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“plan,” “estimate” or similar expressions. These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of management's experience in the
industry as well as its perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate
under the circumstances. You should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Although EXL believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions,
you should be aware that many factors could affect EXL’s actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors, which include our ability to maintain and grow client demand, our ability to hire
and retain sufficiently trained employees, and our ability to accurately estimate and/or manage costs, rising interest rates, rising inflation and
recessionary economic trends, are discussed in more detail in EXL’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including EXL’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K. You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it
is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect EXL. EXL has no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by federal securities laws.

In addition to its reported operating results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), EXL has included in this release
certain financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures, including the following:
(i) Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin;
(ii) Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin;
(iii) Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
(iv) Revenue growth on an organic constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, should not be considered a substitute
for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other
companies. Accordingly, the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial statements should be
carefully evaluated. EXL believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures may help investors better understand EXL’s underlying financial
performance. Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with EXL’s reported results, can provide
useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results and comparisons of the Company’s
results with the results of other companies. Additionally, management considers some of these non-GAAP financial measures to determine variable
compensation of its employees. The Company believes that it is unreasonably difficult to provide its earnings per share financial guidance in
accordance with GAAP, or a qualitative reconciliation thereof, for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the Company’s inability to predict
its future stock-based compensation expense under ASC Topic 718, the amortization of intangibles associated with further acquisitions and the
currency fluctuations and associated tax impacts. As such, the Company presents guidance with respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share. The
Company also incurs significant non-cash charges for depreciation that may not be indicative of the Company’s ability to generate cash flow.
EXL non-GAAP financial measures exclude, where applicable, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible
assets, provision for litigation settlement, non-cash interest expense on convertible senior notes, impairment charges on acquired long-lived and
intangible assets including goodwill, gains or losses on settlement of convertible notes, restructuring charges, effects of termination of leases, certain
defined social security contributions, other acquisition-related expenses or benefits and effect of any non-recurring tax adjustments. Acquisitionrelated expenses or benefits include, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, external deal costs, integration expenses, direct and
incremental travel costs and non-recurring benefits or losses. Our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS also excludes the effects of income
tax on the above pre-tax items, as applicable. The effects of income tax of each item is calculated by applying the statutory rate of the local tax
regulations in the jurisdiction in which the item was incurred.
A limitation of using non-GAAP financial measures versus financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP financial
measures do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our operating results as determined in accordance with GAAP and exclude costs that are
recurring, namely stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. EXL compensates for these limitations by
providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors to evaluate such
non-GAAP financial measures.
The information provided on an organic constant currency basis reflects a comparison of current period results translated at the prior period currency
rates and exclude the impact from an acquisition for a twelve-month period from the date of the acquisition. This information is provided because EXL
believes that it provides useful comparative incremental information to investors regarding EXL’s true operating performance. EXL’s primary exchange
rate exposure is with the Indian rupee, the U.K. pound sterling and the Philippine peso. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the
Indian rupee increased from 74.79 during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 to 82.31 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, representing
a depreciation of 10.1% against the U.S. dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Philippine peso increased from 50.60 during
the quarter ended December 31, 2021 to 56.76 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, representing a depreciation of 12.2% against the U.S.
dollar. The average exchange rate of the U.K. pound sterling against the U.S. dollar decreased from 1.35 during the quarter ended December 31, 2021
to 1.19 during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, representing a depreciation of 12.0% against the U.S. dollar.

Annual report 2023
In 2023, we made significant progress in our journey to become a more innovative and focused company, built around the two most transformational technologies of our time: hybrid cloud and AI. We executed against a proven strategy, refined our portfolio, expanded our ecosystem of partners, and enhanced productivity throughout IBM.

We also continued to address the evolving needs of our clients. As AI becomes a top priority, our clients are using watsonx – IBM’s flagship AI and data platform – to help revolutionize customer service, modernize countless lines of code, and automate enterprise tasks to boost employee productivity.

I have never been more confident in IBM’s direction. Today’s IBM is more capable and more productive. We have a strong portfolio and a solid foundation to support sustainable growth. And we are delivering on our promise to be the catalyst that makes the world work better.

2023 performance

For the year, IBM generated $61.9 billion in revenue, up 3% at constant currency, and $11.2 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year. We experienced growing demand for our new watsonx platform, marked by thousands of client interactions. This demand contributed to roughly doubling the book of business for watsonx and generative AI from the third to the fourth quarter.

We also expanded profit margins by emphasizing high-value offerings in Consulting and Software and by digitally transforming our processes and scaling AI to enhance productivity within IBM.

Software revenues were up more than 5% at constant currency, as clients turned to our advanced software capabilities across hybrid cloud, data & AI, automation, transactions processing, and security. Our performance was led by Red Hat, and we had solid growth in our recurring revenue base.

Consulting revenues were up 6% at constant currency. We capitalized on the growing need for expertise in digital transformation and AI deployment, leveraging our consulting services in data and technology consulting, cloud modernization, application operations, and business transformation.

Infrastructure revenues decreased by 4% at constant currency, in line with the typical product cycle dynamics in this segment. IBM z16 is significantly outperforming previous cycles, demonstrating the enduring value this platform provides to our clients.

IBM’s revenue growth and cash generation enabled us to make substantial investments in the business and deliver value to our shareholders. In 2023, IBM spent nearly $7 billion on research and development, more than $5 billion to acquire nine companies, and returned more than $6 billion to stockholders through dividends.

AI and hybrid cloud continue to drive value creation, allowing businesses to scale, increase productivity, and seize new market opportunities. IBM has built two powerful platforms to capitalize on the strong demand for both technologies: watsonx for AI, and Red Hat OpenShift for hybrid cloud.

Watsonx is our comprehensive AI and data platform, built to deliver AI models and give our clients the ability to manage the entire lifecycle of AI for business, including the training, tuning, deployment, and ongoing governance of those models. As clients shift from experimenting with generative AI to building and deploying it throughout their enterprises, we are focused on practical and urgent business use cases, including code modernization, customer service, and digital labor.

Financial institutions like Citi, Bradesco, and NatWest are using watsonx to help increase productivity, improve code quality, and enhance customer experiences. Our enterprise-ready AI capabilities are being embedded into SAP solutions. EY launched EY.ai Workforce, a new solution that will use watsonx Orchestrate to automate HR tasks and processes. Service partners such as NTT Data Business Solutions, Wipro, and TCS are launching watsonx Centers of Excellence to scale AI-powered client innovations. And generative AI from watsonx, combined with expertise from Consulting, is enhancing the digital experiences of the U.S. Open, the Masters, Wimbledon, the GRAMMYs, and ESPN Fantasy Football.

IBMers are also embracing watsonx to unleash greater productivity, eliminate complexity, simplify workflows, and automate manual tasks. Examples include processing HR and IT tasks more easily, generating code up to 60% faster, and answering client inquiries more quickly.

Hybrid cloud architectures have seen massive adoption, with nearly 80% of IT decision makers operating hybrid cloud environments. But nearly two thirds of companies report difficulty managing these complex environments, a challenge that will grow as businesses deploy generative AI across multiple clouds. IBM’s industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, based on Red Hat OpenShift, can solve this problem. It helps our clients move from architectures that are hybrid by default to architectures that are hybrid by design. It enables companies to run workloads seamlessly across multiple clouds, both public and private, to simplify operations, unify data and applications, and accelerate new innovations. And it complements our watsonx platform, allowing clients the flexibility to manage multi-model AI across complex, multi-cloud environments.

Virgin Money is harnessing IBM’s hybrid cloud to enable new digital customer experiences and improve their credit card services. Red Hat OpenShift is now the preferred platform provider to Nokia’s core network applications business. And the Boston Red Sox are leveraging our hybrid cloud technologies to improve the club’s operations.

Experts from Consulting provide differentiated value as we establish IBM as a leader in AI for business, just as they did with our hybrid cloud business. Our extensive network of data and AI consultants has already facilitated thousands of hands-on client interactions. IBM combines technology with consulting services to deliver the data architecture, security, and governance our clients need to adopt trusted AI solutions.

IBM consultants are working with Riyadh Air on mission-critical technology and business capabilities to support the path to their first flight. NATO chose IBM to help detect and respond to cyber threats with greater speed. And Diageo partnered with Consulting and SAP on an ambitious five-year business transformation and cloud migration.

Throughout 2023, clients modernized their infrastructure with the z16 platform in alignment with their hybrid cloud and AI strategies. IBM launched a new suite of AI offerings for IBM Z along with new machine learning, intelligence, and operational improvements for z/OS.

In addition, we enhanced IBM’s portfolio with nine acquisitions in 2023, including Apptio, a suite of software to help our clients better understand their technology investment and the business value it delivers.

FY23 free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year
Client engagement and partnership

IBM’s success is directly tied to the success of our clients. Their problems are our problems. And their opportunities are our opportunities. That is why we developed a more collaborative, experience-based approach that allows us to respond effectively to their needs.

The IBM Garage Method, now integrated across our business, combines agile development and design thinking to facilitate co-creation with our clients. Clients have embraced this highly collaborative way of working with IBM, turning ideas into outcomes with thousands of Garage engagements throughout the year.

Our approach to client engagement allows us to meet clients where they are, bringing together whatever technology and expertise are needed across our expanding partner ecosystem. That is why we strengthened our strategic partnerships with key industry players like Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce, Samsung, and others. Strategic partnerships now make up more than 40% of our Consulting revenue and delivered double-digit growth in both signings and revenue for the year.

Research and development

In AI, we demonstrated our ability to quickly transform research into commercial applications. We launched the watsonx AI and data platform, introduced the groundbreaking Granite AI foundational model, and developed new AI-optimized hardware.

We have IBM Quantum System One engagements with several leading organizations, including Cleveland Clinic, the Platform for Digital and Quantum Innovation of Quebec, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the University of Tokyo. We also unveiled our 133-qubit Quantum Heron processor, which enhanced the performance, efficiency, and scalability of the newly deployed IBM Quantum System Two. And our work on error correction and mitigation is helping to lay the foundation for a new era of quantum utility.

Research also pushed the limits of semiconductor design and packaging, building on recent innovations such as the 2nm node chip, hybrid bonding, and vertical transistors. We are working with Rapidus to propel Japan’s push for leadership in semiconductor research and manufacturing, and we are participating in an initiative with New York State, Micron, and others to jointly invest $10 billion in semiconductor R&D.

2 Platforms
watsonx for AI and Red Hat OpenShift for hybrid cloud
The promise of IBM

IBM is in the business of shaping the future for our clients. That future must be built on trust.

IBM is at the forefront of technologies, like AI and quantum computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and live. We bear significant responsibility to develop those technologies ethically and deploy them with transparency and trust. That is why we built powerful AI governance into our watsonx platform and developed quantum-safe cryptography to secure sensitive data. It is why we advocate for smart AI regulation, including holding those who develop and deploy AI accountable for fraudulent, discriminatory, and harmful activity. And it is why IBM and Meta announced the formation of the AI Alliance, a group of more than 70 organizations dedicated to advancing open, safe, and responsible AI.

We also earn trust by operating with integrity, staying true to our values, and addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We continue to advance our efforts on the environment, ethics, and education. IBM has achieved a 63% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions against base year 2010. We announced a new program to train 1,000 suppliers in technology ethics by 2025. And IBM committed to training two million learners in AI by the end of 2026 to address the technology skills gap.

But IBM’s commitment to trust goes beyond our citizenship, products, and policies. We earn trust by delivering on our promises.

We articulated a clear vision for the future of IBM in the spring of 2020. We promised a more focused company built around two powerful technologies: hybrid cloud and AI. We promised fundamental changes to our go-to-market strategy, putting clients at the center of everything we do and transforming competitors into partners. And we promised operational changes to simplify our internal processes and increase our productivity. As this report details, we are fulfilling those promises.

As we look ahead, we renew our commitment to the journey we began in 2020. We will continue to innovate, to execute with speed and purpose, find more opportunities for operational efficiency, and further enhance our productivity by employing the same technologies we use to drive growth for our clients. And as always, we will be the catalyst that makes the world work better, bringing together our colleagues, clients, and partners with a simple invitation: Let’s Create. This is the promise of IBM.

Gross margin of approximately 34.5%.
Adjusted income from operations margin10 of approximately 16%.
Our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2024 reflects foreign currency exchange rates as of February 7, 2024.

To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures: 

Adjusted income from operations;
Adjusted income from operations margin;
Adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
Revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations of Genpact's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP financial measures should be carefully evaluated.

Given Genpact's acquisitions of varying scale and size, and the difficulty in predicting expenses relating to acquisitions and the amortization of acquired intangibles thereof, since July 2012 Genpact's management has used financial statements that exclude all acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles for its internal management reporting, budgeting and decision-making purposes, including comparing Genpact's operating results to those of its competitors. For the same reasons, since April 2016, Genpact's management has excluded the impairment of acquired intangible assets from the financial statements it uses for internal management purposes. Acquisition-related expenses are excluded in the period in which an acquisition is consummated. Genpact's management also uses financial statements that exclude stock-based compensation expense. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting ASC 718 "Compensation-Stock Compensation," Genpact's management believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude such expenses allows investors to make additional comparisons between Genpact's operating results and those of other companies.

During the second quarter of 2022, Genpact (a) initiated restructuring measures and, as a result, recorded a charge related to i) right-of-use lease assets and other assets related to certain abandoned leased office properties and ii) employee severance costs resulting from a focused reduction in Genpact's workforce and (b) approved a plan to divest a business that was no longer deemed strategic. Given the specialized nature of this business, we anticipated completing a transaction within twelve months after the end of the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, we classified the revenues and expenses related to this business as held for sale with effect from April 1, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company consummated this transaction and recorded a loss on the sale of the business. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company terminated a lease for office property which was fully impaired as part of a restructuring in the second quarter of 2022, as discussed above, and recorded a gain on such lease termination as restructuring income in the second quarter of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Genpact completed an intercompany transfer of certain intellectual property rights from non-US to US wholly-owned subsidiaries, which resulted in a non-recurring tax benefit of $170 million. Genpact's management believes that excluding these restructuring charges, the loss on the sale of the business previously classified as held for sale, the revenues and expenses associated with such business, the gain on the lease termination and the non-recurring tax benefit on the transfer of intellectual property rights in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to both management and investors regarding the Company's financial performance and underlying business trends. Additionally, in its calculations of non-GAAP financial measures, Genpact's management has adjusted foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income and expense and income tax expenses from GAAP net income, and other income and expenses, and certain gains from GAAP income from operations, because management believes that the Company's results after taking into account these adjustments more accurately reflect the Company's ongoing operations. In its calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share, Genpact's management adds back stock-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses along with the related tax impact of other adjustments and excludes the non-recurring tax benefit on the transfer of intellectual property rights from GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share, the combined current and deferred tax effect is determined by multiplying each pre-tax adjustment by the applicable statutory income tax rate. 

Genpact's management provides information about revenues on a constant currency basis so that the revenues may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared to prior fiscal periods, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's true business performance. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period's foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period.

Accordingly, Genpact believes that the presentation of adjusted income from operations, adjusted income from operations margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share and revenue growth on a constant currency basis, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.

A limitation of using adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin versus income from operations, income from operations margin, net income and net income margin calculated in accordance with GAAP is that these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain recurring costs and certain other charges, namely stock-based compensation expense and amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information on the GAAP amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin.

To supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures:

Adjusted income from operations;
Adjusted income from operations margin;
Adjusted diluted earnings per share; and
Revenue growth on a constant currency basis.
These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliations of Genpact's GAAP financial statements to such non-GAAP financial measures should be carefully evaluated.

Prior to July 2012, Genpact's management used financial statements that excluded significant acquisition-related expenses, amortization of related acquired intangibles, and amortization of acquired intangibles recorded at the company's formation in 2004 for its internal management reporting, budgeting and decision-making purposes, including comparing Genpact's operating results to that of its competitors. However, considering Genpact's acquisitions of varying scale and size, and the difficulty in predicting expenses relating to acquisitions and the amortization of acquired intangibles thereof, since July 2012 Genpact's management has used financial statements that exclude all acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles for its internal management reporting, budgeting and decision-making purposes, including comparing Genpact's operating results to those of its competitors. For the same reasons, since April 2016 Genpact's management has excluded the impairment of acquired intangible assets from the financial statements it uses for internal management purposes.

During the second quarter of 2022, Genpact (a) initiated restructuring measures and, as a result, recorded a charge related to i) right-of-use lease assets and other assets related to certain abandoned leased office properties and ii) employee severance costs resulting from a focused reduction in Genpact's workforce and (b) approved a plan to divest a business that is no longer deemed strategic. Given the specialized nature of this business, we anticipated completing a transaction within twelve months after the end of the second quarter of 2022, and therefore, we classified the revenues and expenses related to this business as held for sale.  Additionally, during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to adjust the carrying amount of the assets of the business designated as held for sale to their fair value. Genpact's management believes that excluding such restructuring charges and the revenues, expenses and impairment charge attributable to the business held for sale in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to both management and investors regarding the Company's financial performance and underlying business trends. Additionally, in its calculations of non-GAAP financial measures, Genpact's management has adjusted foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income and expense and income tax expenses from GAAP net income, and other income and expenses, and certain gains, losses and impairment charges attributable to equity-method investments from GAAP income from operations, because management believes that the Company's results after taking into account these adjustments more accurately reflect the Company's ongoing operations. In its calculations of adjusted diluted earnings per share, Genpact's management adds back adjusted stock-based compensation expense, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and the related tax impact of such adjustments from GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share, the combined current and deferred tax effect is determined by multiplying each pre-tax adjustment by the applicable statutory income tax rate. 

Genpact's management provides information about revenues on a constant currency basis so that the revenues may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations compared to prior fiscal periods, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of the Company's true business performance. Revenue growth on a constant currency basis is calculated by restating current-period activity using the prior fiscal period's foreign currency exchange rates adjusted for hedging gains/losses in such period.

Accordingly, Genpact believes that the presentation of adjusted income from operations, adjusted income from operations margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share and revenue growth on a constant currency basis, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.

A limitation of using adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin versus income from operations, income from operations margin, net income and net income margin calculated in accordance with GAAP is that these non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain recurring costs and certain other charges, namely stock-based compensation expense and amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information on the GAAP amounts excluded from adjusted income from operations and adjusted income from operations margin.

Summary -

From the financial data for EXL, IBM, and Genpact for 2022 to Q2 2024, here is a comparative analysis that positions these three companies in a competitive context:
Revenue Growth
 
    EXL: The company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth across quarters. For Q2 2024, EXL reported a revenue of $448.4 million, which is a 10.7% increase from Q2 2023. Over the past few years, EXL has maintained a growth trajectory, with 2023 annual revenue reaching $1.63 billion, up by 15.5% year-over-year.
    IBM: IBM continues to lead in terms of total revenue. For Q2 2024, IBM generated $15.8 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, with steady growth in its software and infrastructure segments. Although the growth is slower in percentage terms compared to EXL and Genpact, IBM’s sheer scale keeps it at the top of the market. In 2023, IBM reported a total annual revenue of $61.9 billion, an increase of 3% at constant currency.
    Genpact: Genpact has also shown steady growth, with Q2 2024 revenue reaching $1.18 billion, a 6% increase from the previous year (7% in constant currency). In comparison, its 2023 revenue growth was aligned with EXL in percentage terms, indicating its growing competitive positioning.
 
Profit Margins
 
    EXL: The operating income margin for EXL in Q2 2024 was 13.7%, which has seen a slight decrease from 16.0% in Q2 2023. However, the adjusted operating income margin was stronger at 19.8%. This indicates EXL's ability to manage its operations effectively, despite some pressure on margins.
    IBM: IBM's gross profit margin for Q2 2024 stood at 56.8% (GAAP), reflecting a strong operational efficiency in its software and infrastructure businesses. The company's strategic focus on hybrid cloud and AI, along with product mix improvements, has helped maintain healthy margins. IBM also posted a pre-tax income margin of 14.1%.
    Genpact: Genpact's diluted EPS for Q2 2024 increased by 6% to $0.67, with adjusted diluted EPS up 10% to $0.79. Although Genpact’s margins aren't as high as IBM’s, the growth in EPS reflects operational improvements and cost efficiency measures.
 
Strategic Focus
 
    EXL: EXL’s strategic focus is heavily on data analytics and AI-led operations. With the acquisition of ITI Data and collaborations with NVIDIA, EXL is pushing to strengthen its position in high-growth sectors like banking, insurance, and healthcare.

    IBM: IBM has demonstrated significant free cash flow generation, with $4.5 billion in free cash flow in Q2 2024, allowing the company to continue its strategy of investing in AI, cloud, and strategic acquisitions. IBM's strong cash position supports both innovation and shareholder returns.
    Genpact: Genpact’s robust cash flow has allowed it to increase its earnings guidance and continue its focus on innovation, particularly in AI. Genpact’s cash flow management reflects its commitment to reinvesting in technology to support future growth.
 
Competitive Positioning
 
    EXL: Positioned as a strong player in the data analytics and digital operations space, EXL competes directly with other data-driven service providers. Its focus on AI-led strategy and domain expertise offers differentiation in a crowded market.
    IBM: IBM remains a dominant player in enterprise technology, with its vast portfolio in hybrid cloud and AI solutions setting it apart. Its scale and depth in AI and cloud infrastructure make it a formidable competitor, especially against smaller firms.
    Genpact: Genpact competes by focusing on professional services and operational excellence. Its integration of AI into core services strengthens its position in the business process outsourcing sector and aligns with future trends in digital transformation.
 
Conclusion
 
    IBM leads in terms of scale and strategic positioning in AI and cloud, giving it a strong competitive advantage, especially with its focus on hybrid cloud solutions.
    EXL shows robust growth in the data analytics space and is well-positioned to capitalize on AI-driven trends, making it a strong competitor in its niche.
    Genpact continues to perform well by leveraging AI and operational execution, positioning itself as a key player in business process management with a focus on technological innovation.
 
In a competitive context, IBM's strength lies in its ability to scale AI and cloud solutions across industries, while EXL and Genpact are focused on niche growth and operational efficiency through AI and data-driven strategies.
